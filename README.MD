# <Homework-1-Horiseon>
## Description

this projects was requested by the customer, the customer stated that wanted to have the code refactored. (improving the code withoout changing what it does.)

My motivacion, was to have the customer satisfied with the following points.

*have a cleaner and more precise code. that will be helpful in the long run of the page.
*gave a clear view of the structure of the HTML elements.
*when we view the images even if there is no internet all of the images have a description of what they do.
*reworked the style.css, to have it working efficiently, (I noticed that a lot spam was made on Style.css so I left only the essential parts for the webpage.)
*I solved the first link of the webpage was not taged correcly I change it to ID after. so it worked as an actual hyperlink on the same webpage. Also there was a tag called span that didn't do anything and this was done on the header. I deleted it and left it without tags.
I learned to take my time and see slowly what was intended to happen in a set of code. and to ask myself what can I do to improve what it is already done.

# Bugs

there are still somebugs that have not been able to be fixed by my part, which are a title problem at the beggining of the Index.html code, and also a problem with the hyperlinks. Two of them are not working eventhough I tried my best to make the code work.
